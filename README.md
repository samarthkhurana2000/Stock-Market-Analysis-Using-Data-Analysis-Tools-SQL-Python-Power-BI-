Stock market analysis for informed decisions and manage the risk in the investments
* Title :-        **Stock Market Analysis For The Sub-Sector Of Auto Parts**
* Created by :-   SAMARTH
* Date :-         05-07-2023
* Tool used:-    PYTHON(Google Collab).<br>,SQL(MY SQL WORKBENCH) AND .<br>POWER BI DESKTOP (For Visualization)

  # Introduction :-
* This is the Group Project In which Each student got Different Sub- Sector To analyze the Stocks.
* In this project, we will be analyzing Stocks data to gain insights for informed decisions.
* We are given with the data in which various sub-sector are there but my work is to analyze only that stocks which came under **'Auto Parts'** Sub-Sector.
* We Will use **SQL** for Data Cleaning (Changing the column names,Checking The Null Values and filling the null values of Auto parts Sub-Sector etc.).
* After That we will use Python for Data Manipulation and transformation using Python Libraries (Pandas and Numpy).
* Calculate Various Ratios in Python (Analyst Buy Ratio, Profit Margin, Profit After Tax).
* At Last we will use Power BI For Data Visualization.

 # Data :- 
*  I got this Dataset from Institute(IMS ProSchool) as it was a group project.
*  Stock Market Analysis contains 1 CSV File
*  This Dataset Contains information about the stock accorduing to various companies.

  # Approach:-
## 1. SQL (Data Cleaning) : 
► Rename the Table Name and various column names for clarity and readability.<br>
► We Checked the null values are there in the ** Auto Parts** sector in all the columns.<br>
► In ** 1year_future_growth** and in various columns we found that there are null values.<br>
► Our next approach is to fill those null values with the average of the particular column.<br>
► At Last we will write the query to check whether null values are filled or not .

## 2. Python Extraction: 
► Retrieve Cleaned data from SQL as CSV.<br>
► Add the data into Python and use pandas, NumPy for further transformation and analysis.<br>
► Calculate returns, identify trends.<br>
►  Ratios calculated on Python include the following:.<br>
(a) Change in Retail Holdings.<br>
(b) Analyst Buy Ratio.<br>
(c) Profit Margin.<br>
(d) Profit After Tax.<br>
(e) Earnings Per Share (EPS).<br>
(f) Return on Equity (ROE).<br>
(g) PS Ratio

## 3.Power BI for Data Visualization : 
► Extract data from Python as csv.<br>
► Calculate New Column Using Power Query Editor for Types of Market Cap.<br>
► > 5000 and <20000 for mid cap,>20000 for Large cap.<br>
► 131 customers are visiting their local restaurants & 14 customers are visiting outside of their locality.<br>
